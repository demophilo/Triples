# Triples
## Introduction
This small programm defines funktions to calculate pythagorian triples and trojan triples to a given natural number. Pythagorean triples are natural numbers, which satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Trojan triples are natural numbers, which satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 - a*b = c^2 or the equation a^2 + b^2 + a*b = c^2. If the edges of a triangle are a pythagorean triple there is one 90°-angle. If the edges of a triangle are a trojan triple there is one 60°-angle or one 120°-angle.
These functions are used to either to help teachers finding beautiful exercises for their students ore to investigate such triangles.
## Name
Though some mathematicians call the trojan triples antipythagorean triples, I don't use that term, because that expression is missleading. The prefix anti indicates that somthing is the opposite of another. The angles 60° and 120° look more like the trojans of a planet, which share the orbit with the planet, but leading or trailing about 60° in relation to the planet. The trojan triples are 30° ahead ore 30° behind the dominant 90°-angle.
## Some results
The following results are not proven as far as I know. Therfore they are conjectures.
- Prime numbers >2 are part of one or two pythagorean triples.
- The sum of triples of twin primes is exactly 3. For the twin primes 3 and 5 the triple (3, 4, 5) is counted once for 3 and once for 5.
- Every natural number >2 is part at least of one pythagoren triple.
- Every natural number >2 exept 4 is part at least of one trojan triple.
